lots of bugs in this checkpoint

- can't seem to get the dropzones working correctly
- the mixer board could be moved up a bit
- at some point i'll need to add some placeholder audio so i know the drop functions work properly

what went right!

- added proper icons for the "beat blocks" 
- got a better font in for the webpage 
- adjusted the site measurements a bit
